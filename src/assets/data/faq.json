      "question": "Ombré or Balayage? What's the difference?",
      "answer": "Ombré is a \"look\" and balayage is a \"technique\". Ombré is a gradual colour that typically goes from dark to light. Balayage means \"to sweep\" - we use a variety of balayage techniques that we are highly skilled at to achieve a customized look that suits you!"
