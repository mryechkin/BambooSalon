She always listens to my thoughts and ideas, takes time to walk me through options and I have never let an appointment unhappy. Tiffany is always open to my ever changing styles and extremely easy to work with. All of the staff at the salon are incredibly friendly and helpful. I have referred a number of friends and family and am always 100%  confident that they too will love Tiffany and the staff at Bamboo. I trust this salon 100% and a highly recommend them to anyone. Whether it be the online scheduling or the friendly faces when you walk in, you can't go wrong with Bamboo Salon!",

I have two small children and can't get into the salon nearly as often as I would like to...when I mentioned this to Haley, she so quickly knew exactly what to do to give me a fresh, fun look that is also very low maintenance. She not only excels at actually working with hair, she's great at envisioning how to best execute a style that not only looks great, but also works with a client's preferred styling schedule. All of the staff at Bamboo are friendly and approachable, the environment relaxing and enjoyable to be in. Our whole family has switched our services over to them. Can't recommend enough!!",

I have recommended Tiffany and her staff to many and there is no higher compliment in my mind! They are loyal, knowledgeable and fun! The atmosphere is relaxing, laid back and fun! I have been with Tiffany since the beginning and I will be there until the end! Thank you Bamboo for letting my family be part of your family!",

Let's face it, not everyone can pull the latest trends off. I always leave feeling confident that I made the right decision. Thanks Tiffany, I completely trust my hair to you. My boys and husband also go to Nick and always leave looking even more handsome then when they came. Signed - a Bamboo Babe and grateful customer ‚ù§",

They still use Bamboo Salon and the stylists after all of these years. Tiff has always been flexible with my schedule and tries to accommodate all of her clients. I leave the Salon always feeling fantastic. She has been hiliting and cutting my hair and my children's hair since they were very little. My now 16 year old daughter has had her hair styled for some wonderful events by Bamboo Salon. When Tiff's schedule is packed they always accommodate with another stylist. My daughter raves about Amber and Hailey's cuts as well. I am a fan of Tiff's and once you find a great stylist you never want to switch. My son used to use Tiff and Amber but won't let anyone but Nick cut his hair now.  He just knows what teens want.  My husband just recently gave up his barber and now enjoys the Nick's haircut as well. Walking into Bamboo Salon you immediately feel the warmth and caring atmosphere. It's like having coffee with girlfriends. You will always enjoy your time.",

I have referred many friends, co-workers and family to the Bamboo Salon, as it is such an inviting, friendly environment - and will continue to do so. The on-line appointment booking is quick and easy, and gives you a handy reminder email. My 3 boys also see Nick - their barber.  My clean cut, handsome men walk out of there boasting with confidence and can't wait to go back! Highly recommend this Salon for any of their services!",
